The Odin Project: Etch-a-sketch

From The Odin Project's [curriculum] (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

Guess I don't have to explain what the project is. Just anothe Etch-a-sketch.

Special stuff:
-> Uses Comic Sans MS (hope you have it installed). Suffer well!
-> Opacity buttons - choose whether you want to increase opacity of a given cell by 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 or 1 anytime you click it or hover         above it while holding down LMB. If the color you have chosen is different thant the color of the cell you want to paint, it will            replace the cell's color with your color of choice and set the opacity to whatever is chosen at the moment.
-> Drawing requires LMB to be down. Cells react to a single click (at the moment of the click, releasing is ignored) or hovering above them         while LMB is still down.
-> You can specify both the width and the height of the grid in cells. The shape of the container DIV stays the same -- it is the cells             which are subjected to shape change (either square or non-square rectangle). This is intentional. If you want to make sure your cells        are square no matter what, there's a special Cell Type Button waiting for you. Also memorizes some stuff, though it's pointless to 
       describe it now. You'll figure it out on your own.
-> Random Color Button. Switch the opacity to 1 when activated (you can change is back while it's active) which remembers the last opacity          value so that when you deactivate the RCB, you will go back to your last used opacity before you had clicked the RCB. Also makes the 
       Color Changing Button show "IGNORED" while the RCB is active.

Not all function ideas were mine ofc, thus I wanted to do something above the curriculum and learn some more nice stuff.
Hope you'll find some useful functions in my code for your studies.
